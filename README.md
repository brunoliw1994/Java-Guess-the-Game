# Guess the Number Game (Java)

This Java-based "Guess the Number" game is designed to illustrate key object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance and abstraction while also practicing user input and output handling.

In this game, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it within a fixed number of attempts.

The primary goal of this project is to **demonstrate** the usage of the `extends` and `abstract` keywords in Java, highlighting concepts like **encapsulation** and **abstraction** through an engaging, interactive experience.
